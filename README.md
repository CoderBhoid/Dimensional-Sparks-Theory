> "What if Gravity isn't a force, but the universe lagging due to high information density?"

**Dimensional Spark Theory (DST)** is a new physical framework proposed by independent researcher **Ayush Pal**. It resolves key discrepancies between General Relativity and Quantum Mechanics by redefining the universe not as a machine, but as a recursive information processing system (or a living organism).

## 🌌 The Core Concept
Standard physics breaks down at singularities (Black Holes, The Big Bang). DST fixes this by introducing a non-zero dimensional limit: **The Dimensional Spark**.

Instead of treating Mass and Gravity as fundamental, DST derives them from **Information**:
* **Gravity:** The attractive tension caused by the compression of data (Information).
* **Dark Energy:** The repulsive pressure caused by information density resistance.
* **Time:** The local processing rate (or metabolic rate) of the system, which slows down under load (Time Dilation).
* **$c$ (Speed of Light):** The maximum bandwidth/transmission rate of the universal processor.

## 🧮 The Physics Engine (Calculator)
Included in this repository is `index.html`, a **Strict DST Physics Engine**. 

Unlike standard gravity calculators that use Newton's Constant ($G$) and Mass ($kg$), this engine calculates gravity using **Bits of Information**.

### How it works:
1.  **Converts Mass to Bits:** Uses the Landauer-Energy equivalence ($1 \text{ bit} \approx 3.0 \times 10^{-38} \text{ kg}$).
2.  **Applies Bandwidth Limit:** Applies the **Spark Gravitational Constant** ($\mathcal{G}_s \approx 2.0 \times 10^{-48}$).
3.  **Calculates Net Force:** The engine balances Gravitational Pull against Quantum Repulsion.

### The Proof:
When you load the **Planet Earth** preset:
* Standard Physics Input: $5.97 \times 10^{24}$ kg
* DST Output: **9.81 m/s²**
* **Result:** The calculator successfully derives Newtonian gravity solely from Information Theory.

## 📄 The Research Paper
The full theoretical framework is available in the PDF included in this repo: [**DST (4).pdf**](./DST%20(4).pdf).

### Key Anomalies Solved:
| Anomaly | Standard Model Explanation | DST Explanation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Cosmic Inflation** | Theoretical "Inflaton Field" turned on/off. | **Gravity Lag:** Gravity didn't exist until Matter formed ($10^{-32}s$). Without gravity, expansion was unchecked. |
| **Singularity Collapse** | "Math breaks down" (Infinity). | **Quantum Repulsion:** Information density pressure prevents total collapse, stabilizing Neutron Stars. |
| **Early Galaxies (JWST)** | Not enough time for accretion. | **Fractal Inheritance:** Matter filled pre-existing "Metadata Grids" from the parent universe. |
| **Entanglement** | "Spooky Action at a Distance." | **Shared Memory:** Particles are pointers referencing the same source address. |
| **Dark Matter** | Invisible particles? | **System Metadata:** The weight of the space-time coordinate grid itself. |

## 🔢 The Unifying Equation
The DST Field Equation replaces the separation between Quantum Mechanics and Relativity:

$$F_{net} = \underbrace{- \frac{\mathcal{G}_s \cdot I}{r^2}}_{\text{Gravitational Pull}} + \underbrace{\Phi \cdot \left( \frac{\rho_I}{\rho_{crit}} \right)^n}_{\text{Quantum Repulsion}}$$

Where:
* $I$ = Total Information (Bits)
* $\mathcal{G}_s$ = Spark Gravitational Constant
* $\rho_I$ = Information Density
* $\Phi$ = Spark Modulus (Structural Integrity)

## 🧪 Predictions
1.  **Neutron Star Stability:** Super-dense objects are supported by Informational Pressure, not just degeneracy pressure.
2.  **Infinite Storage:** Data capacity is limited by energy density, not volume. 1D "Spark Drives" are theoretically possible.
3.  **Cosmic Integration:** The universe is not heading toward Heat Death, but toward **Saturation**—the integration of all complexity (consciousness/life) into the seed for the next dimensional cycle.
